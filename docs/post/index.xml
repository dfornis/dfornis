      <description>Introduction Randomly assigned controlled experiments are, naturally, a favored tool by scientists who want to make claims about causality in research. They are however expensive, impractical and often ethically dubious to run in a social science or policy context. Consider the country that randomly assigns its regions into a treatment and control group when implementing criminal justice reform, in order to find out if it has the intended effect, all else equal.</description>

      <description>Background How long is the wait for a rental apartment in Stockholm? It&amp;rsquo;s an engaging question in the spotlight of both politics and daily life in the Swedish capital. In light of a recent surge in news articles about how young swedes struggle to enter the housing market, I took a look at data provided by Stockholms Bostadsk√∂ - Stockholm&amp;rsquo;s sole distributor of rental apartments. It tells a story about a deteriorating rental market with a rapidly growing wait time for apartments (Swedes queue for apartments: Soviet style).</description>

      <description>While initially hesitant, owing to a sense that I would rather be involved in actual research, visualizing data turned out to be a creative outlet in the midst of more heavy data wrangling and theoretical work.
All visualizations were made in R with ggplot2.
Climate adaption The first set of visualizations were made from a large panel dataset on the climate adaption activities of international organizations, developed for a PHD thesis by Ece Kural.</description>

      <title>Nowcasting a leading economic indicator in times of uncertainty - with R</title>

      <description>Macroeconomic indicators are traditionally collected with a large lag. This limits their utility in times of high uncertainty. In a pandemic for example, infection rates may accelerate non-linearly (as seen in SIR-models) and are likely to react to variables such as temperature and degree of immunity, many of which remain unknown at the beginning of a pandemic. Nowcasting has been suggested by the Swedish Riksbank (Andersson, Reijer 2015) among others as a tool to make predictions with higher frequency data.</description>
