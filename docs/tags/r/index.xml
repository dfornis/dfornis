      <description>One thing this pandemic has been a humbling reminder of is of our inability to make accurate predictions. Economic forecasts have proven to be as unreliable as predictions on infection rates. Part of the difficulty lies in economics being downstream from the development of the pandemic. Higher infection rates leads to lower mobility which leads to lower economic activity. In these cases, complexity in modeling doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily help. My idea for an improvement is to circumnavigate the pandemic predictions in order to make 1-week-ahead forecasts of movement patterns with a novel data source and a simple model.</description>
