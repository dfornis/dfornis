      <description>Part of the difficulty lies in economic indicators being downstream from the development of the pandemic. Higher infection rates leads to lower mobility which leads to lower economic activity. Macroeconomic indicators are also collected with a large enough lag to make them unusable for making the kinds of short time horizon forecasts that are valuable in times of high uncertainty.
My idea was to circumnavigate this issue by making 1-week-ahead forecasts of movement patterns with an ARIMAX model where Google Trends data supply leading indicators as external variables in the model.</description>
