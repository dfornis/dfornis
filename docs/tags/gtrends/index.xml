      <description>Economic forecasts have proven to be as unreliable as predictions on infection rates. Part of the difficulty lies in economics being downstream from the development of the pandemic. Higher infection rates leads to lower mobility which leads to lower economic activity. In this context, complexity in modeling doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily help.
My idea was to circumnavigate the pandemic predictions in order to make 1-week-ahead forecasts of movement patterns with a slightly unconventional data source and a simple model.</description>
