      <description>Macroeconomic indicators are traditionally collected with a large lag. This limits their utility in times of high uncertainty. In a pandemic for example, infection rates may accelerate non-linearly (as seen in SIR-models) and are likely to react to variables such as temperature and degree of immunity, many of which remain unknown at the beginning of a pandemic. Nowcasting has been suggested by the Swedish Riksbank (Andersson, Reijer 2015) among others as a tool to make predictions with higher frequency data.</description>
