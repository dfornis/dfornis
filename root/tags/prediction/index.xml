      <description>There is an unmistakably niche but growing field in economics. It&amp;rsquo;s an approach that has been somewhat successfully advocated for by Robert Shiller and George Akerlof for some time now. It has featured as a theme in many works without being mentioned by name, such as in Galbraith&amp;rsquo;s classic &amp;ldquo;The Great Crash of 1929&amp;rdquo; from 1955. But tracing its origins takes us back as far as the 1930&amp;rsquo;s when Keynes coined the phrase Animal Spirits, meant to capture a characteristic of human behavior beyond what was imagined in the classical models of economics.</description>
