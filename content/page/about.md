I have recently completed a master's degree in Economic History at Stockholm University. I currently work as a research assistant within the resarch project GlocalClim at the department of Economic History and International Relations at Stockholm University. I also do freelance work as a quantitative analyst. My main areas of interest are econometric inference, globalization and values as well as the history of information technology.
